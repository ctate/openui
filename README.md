## Overview

OpenUI is a specification for standardizing UI components across different libraries and frameworks. It promotes interoperability and consistent user experiences by defining common properties and behaviors for UI elements.

## Introduction

OpenUI aims to create a universal language for UI design, similar to how OpenAPI standardizes the description of REST APIs. By defining components and their props in a machine-readable format, OpenUI provides a framework-agnostic approach to documenting UI libraries.

## Features

- Standardized component definitions
- Framework-agnostic specifications
- Support for multiple UI libraries (shadcn/ui, Material UI, Chakra UI, React Spectrum)
- Interactive examples and previews
- Detailed documentation
